 * Defines an item constraint group.

 * - `BLOCKS` -> `128..`
 * - `TNT` -> `..64`
 *
 * Imagine a situation where the player has 125 TNT:
 * - If the TNT was processed first it would be thrown out since the TNT limit says that we have too much TNT.
 * - If the BLOCKS constraint was processed first, the TNT would be kept since the BLOCKS constraint is not yet
